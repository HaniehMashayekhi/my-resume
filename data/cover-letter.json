      "I am applying for the On-call Trainee, Data Science & Business Analytics position in Vaasa, driven by a deep commitment to learning and supporting Wartsila's mission through data.",
      "I acknowledge I am a beginner with specialized tools like Databricks and UiPath, but I offer a profile aligned with your core requirement: rapid, communicative growth. As a local IT Engineering student, I possess foundational familiarity with technical concepts, including Python, SQL, C, and automation logic in Go/Bash.",
      "More uniquely, I combine this technical foundation with advanced communication ability from my Masters in Education. This helps me engage with non-technical shopfloor teams, translate complex findings clearly, and support collaboration required for system integration.",
      "I am a proactive, self-driven learner eager to quickly convert this foundation into measurable value for your team."
